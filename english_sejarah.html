        Indonesia’s Independence on August 17, 1945 did not immediately bring an
        end to the nation’s struggle. The Westerling Tragedy stands as one of
        the darkest chapters in Indonesian history.

        <h3>
          Initial Conditions of South Sulawesi After Independence (the end of
          1945)
        </h3>

            Following the proclamation of independence in 1945, the people of
            South Sulawesi expressed their support for the Republic of
            Indonesia. In various regions, such as Makassar, Parepare, Bone, and
            Barru, they formed republican governments and resisted Dutch
            attempts to regain power. However, when Allied and Dutch troops
            landed in Makassar in late 1945, the situation began to change.
            <br /><img src="image/nica.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
            The Dutch, through the NICA (Netherlands Indies Civil
            Administration), attempted to regain control of the region. They
            viewed the popular resistance as a threat to "public order." The
            popular resistance, which employed guerrilla tactics in rural areas,
            made it difficult for the Dutch to control the entire region.
            Therefore, they decided to send special forces trained for this type
            of warfare, the Depot Speciale Troepen (DST).

        <h3>Arrival of Westerling's Troops (December 1946)</h3>
        <button class="mini-btn" onclick="toggleSection('sec2', this)">Next</button>

            <img src="image/raydandpt.jpg" width="400" height="auto" /><br />
            In December 1946, Captain Raymond Westerling and his DST troops
            arrived in Makassar. They arrived with a mission to crush a group
            considered rebels and restore "security" to the South Sulawesi
            region. However, Westerling's methods were utterly inhumane.
            <br /><img src="image/westerling.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
            Westerling implemented a strategy he called the "Westerling method,"
            an extreme military action involving gathering villagers in a
            village, separating those suspected of involvement, and subjecting
            them to violent interrogations. Anyone deemed guilty was shot on the
            spot without trial. This brutal campaign began in several villages
            around Tremboe (now Pinrang Regency) and then spread to other areas
            such as Suppa, Parepare, Bulukumba, Enrekang, and Bone
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Mass Execution (1946 - 1947)</h3>
        <button class="mini-btn" onclick="toggleSection('sec3', this)">Next</button>

          <p>
            <img src="image/operasi.jpg" width="400" height="auto" /><br />
            Westerling's first operation was in Tremboe on December 11, 1946.
            There, the villagers were gathered in the village square early in
            the morning. The DST troops ordered all adult males to line up and
            surrender their weapons. Afterward, they were interrogated one by
            one. Anyone accused of being a member or supporter of the Republic
            was immediately and publicly executed. Many were shot without any
            evidence, based solely on suspicion or one-sided reports. Following
            the operation in Tremboe,
            <br /><img src="image/jalandesa.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
            Westerling continued his operations in other villages. In each
            village, the same pattern was followed: Dutch troops searched
            residents' homes, burned down houses suspected of harboring
            fighters, and executed anyone accused of involvement in the
            resistance movement. The bodies of the victims were left lying
            without proper burials, as a form of terror to deter other villagers
            from resisting. According to eyewitness accounts, Westerling himself
            often led the executions. He stood before the line of villagers with
            a pistol in his hand and shot the victims one by one in the head.
            These sadistic acts were even witnessed by children and women. In
            some cases, Westerling ordered local soldiers collaborating with the
            Dutch to also shoot, to deter them from disobeying his orders.
          </p>

        <h3>Spread to Other Areas (January 1947)</h3>
        <button class="mini-btn" onclick="toggleSection('sec4', this)">Next</button>
        <div id="sec4" class="hidden">
          <p>
            <img src="image/jalan2.jpg" width="400" height="auto" /><br />
            In January 1947, Operation DST expanded. The Barru, Enrekang, and
            Bone regions became the next targets. In the Parepare area, hundreds
            of residents were killed simply for their alleged links to the
            Republican guerrilla forces. Villages suspected of harboring
            fighters were razed to the ground. Westerling also formed a local
            spy group tasked with reporting on anyone deemed "anti-Dutch."
            However, these reports were often used for personal revenge,
            resulting in many innocent people being executed. Within a short
            time, thousands of people had become victims. Survivors described
            the operation as being carried out with strict military discipline
            and proceeding with incredible speed. In a single night, entire
            villages could be depopulated. This violence continued for several
            weeks without interruption
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Reaction of the Republican Government (January-February 1947)</h3>
        <button class="mini-btn" onclick="toggleSection('sec5', this)">Next</button>
        <div id="sec5" class="hidden">
          <p>
            <img src="image/pemerintah.jpg" width="400" height="auto" /><br />
            The Indonesian government, based in Yogyakarta at the time, could do
            little because South Sulawesi was under Dutch occupation. However,
            reports of Westerling's atrocities reached Republican leaders
            through letters and testimonies from refugees. The Republican
            government then strongly condemned these actions and presented them
            as evidence of Dutch war crimes in international forums. Despite
            this, the Dutch continued to try to cover up the incident. They
            claimed that Westerling was only carrying out "security" measures
            against rebels, not a massacre of civilians.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>End of Operation (February 1947)</h3>
        <button class="mini-btn" onclick="toggleSection('sec6', this)">Next</button>
        <div id="sec6" class="hidden">
          <p>
            <img
              src="image/sialmondpulangjir.jpg"
              width="400"
              height="auto"
            /><br />
            After approximately three months of military operations, Westerling
            reported to his superiors that the situation in South Sulawesi was
            "secure." The operation ended in February 1947, but what remained
            was destruction, grief, and suffering for the people. Thousands of
            families lost their lives, many villages were completely destroyed,
            and deep trauma gripped the local community for years.
            <br /><img src="image/almondbayi.jpg" width="400" height="auto" />
            After the operation, Westerling was never tried for his brutal
            actions. He was even returned to the Netherlands and lived a normal
            life without punishment. This is clear evidence that the Dutch
            colonial government turned a blind eye to these egregious human
            rights violations. Despite this, the Indonesian people have never
            forgotten this event. The tragedy of the Westerling Massacre
            symbolizes the suffering and determination of the Indonesian people
            in defending their independence from colonial rule.
